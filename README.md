# Corporate Spend Sample PBIX

## Overview

A comprehensive corporate IT spending analysis dashboard providing year-to-date (YTD) budget tracking, variance analysis, and trend forecasting. This project enables financial and operations teams to monitor spending patterns across multiple IT business areas and geographic regions, with detailed plan variance tracking and period-by-period performance metrics.

## How to Use

1. **Open Dashboard**: Launch .pbix files in Power BI Desktop
2. **Select Region**: Use dropdown to filter by geographic region (currently set to Europe)
3. **Review Metrics**: Examine KPI cards for quick variance snapshot
4. **Analyze Trends**: Review line charts and area charts for spend patterns
5. **Drill Down**: Click on dimensions to explore detailed variance by category
6. **Export Reports**: Generate PDF or Excel exports for stakeholder review

---

## Key Metrics Explained

**Actual Spend**: Verified expenses incurred in current period

**Plan**: Budgeted amount for the period

**Variance (Var)**: Difference between actual and planned spending
- Positive variance = Over budget
- Negative variance = Under budget

**Var LE1, LE2, LE3**: Multi-level variance calculations at different organizational hierarchies

**Var Plan %**: Overall percentage variance from total budget plan

**YTD**: Year-to-Date cumulative metrics

---

## Variance Analysis Interpretation

**Positive Variance (Over Budget):**
- Infrastructure area consistently over budget ($1.61M)
- Indicates higher-than-anticipated IT infrastructure costs

**Negative Variance (Under Budget):**
- R&D and Services areas showing savings
- BU spending comes under control by year-end

**Monthly Trend:**
- Early year (Jan-Mar): Significant negative variances
- Mid year (Apr-Aug): Convergence toward plan
- Year-end (Sep-Dec): Positive variances indicating accelerated spending

---

## Interactive Filters

- **Sales Region Selector**: Focus analysis by geographic region
- **Period Filter**: Analyze specific time periods or ranges
- **Business Area Filter**: Drill into specific departments
- **Variance Type Filter**: View only over/under budget items

---

## Performance Optimization

- Use region filters to reduce data volume
- Archive prior year data separately
- Index spending and plan tables
- Refresh data during off-peak hours
- Consider incremental data loads for large datasets

## Troubleshooting

**Variance Calculations Not Updating**
- Verify data source connection
- Check that latest data has been imported
- Refresh Power BI data model

**Missing Regional Data**
- Confirm region is selected in filter
- Check data for region exists in source
- Verify user permissions for that region

**Slow Dashboard Performance**
- Reduce date range scope
- Filter to specific business areas
